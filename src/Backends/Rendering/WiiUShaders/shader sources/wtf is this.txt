# How to compile shaders #
##########################

I'mma give it to you straight: compiling shaders for the Wii U is an absolute
nightmare.

You see, there are three major steps:
* Compile the GLSL to assembly
* Fill in a header by-hand
* Assemble the assembly + header

To compile, you need AMD's 'GPU ShaderAnalyzer', which is Windows-only:
https://gpuopen.com/archive/gpu-shaderanalyzer/

You then need to compile for the RV730.

After that, you need to fill-in a header. The only way I was able to figure out
what little I did was by finding examples on the internet:
https://github.com/snickerbockers/gx2gl/tree/master/src/shaders
https://github.com/yawut/SDL/tree/wiiu-2.0.9/src/video/wiiu/shaders
https://github.com/devkitPro/wut/tree/master/samples/cmake/content

Even now, I don't have a complete idea of exactly what everything means.

Anyway, once you have *that* out of the way, you still need to assemble your
shaders. For that, you'll need `latte-assembler` - a tool that comes with the
Decaf emulator.

For me, I needed to clone the entire source tree (and its dependencies) in order
to build the tool successfully, which is a royal pain in the ass.

For compilation, I used MSYS2+MinGW-w64. There were a couple of compilation
errors I had to address, but nothing too hard to solve.

Eventually you'll have the assembler built. With it, you can link your `.psh`
and `.vsh` files into the final `.gsh` blob.

Oh, right. I should warn you - the devs changed latte-assembler's syntax at some
point, so all the example `.psh`/`.vsh` files I could find online were
incompatible. That sucked. The main change was that stuff like 'float2' and
'float4' were changed to 'vec2' and 'vec4'. Just keep that in mind, and you
should be okay.

Also, latte-assembler's 'assemble' command was originally named 'compile', and
the other 'compile' option didn't exist. Keep that in mind if you ever find any
documentation on how to use the tool.

latte-assembler does have an option to convert straight from GLSL to `.gsh`, but
this feature is woefully incomplete (it doesn't support `sampler2D`), and not
worth using.
